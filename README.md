# Group10-Construction-Agent
AI Multi-Agent Competition at the UC Berkeley Agentic AI Summit, sponsored by Schmidt Sciences

We are a team of 3: Haonan Zhu, Yuexing Hao, and Manikanta Illuri. In August 2nd, 2025, we built a multi-agent system, titled "ConstructionAgent," which involves multiple agents in building a üè† townhouse. 

In the game, we randomly assigned an equal number of tools to the agents. Then, based on each agent's tasks and needs, the agents can trade with each other through conversations. Running our colab, you can see how these agents collaborate and trade with each other, and build a beautiful townhouse afterwards!

Can't wait to see how the multi-agent works? Try our codes!!
